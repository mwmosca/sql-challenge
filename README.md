# sql-challenge
This project demonstrates the analysis of a historical employee database using postgreSQL in pgAdmin 4. To run the code:
1) Download the data files and SQL files.
2) Create a new database in pgAdmin.
3) Execute the schema.sql file to create the table structure. An entity relationship diagram is provided to visualize the table structure.
4) Import the .csv files into their corresponding tables. The data must be imported in the same order the tables were created to preserve the foreign key relationships.
5) Execute the analysis.sql queries to view the results.
